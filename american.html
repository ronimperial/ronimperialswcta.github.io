    <h2>My American Revolution War Draft team essay meets standard 1.3 because it summarizes how the American Revolution outcomes impacted American politics. In my American Revolution War Draft team essay, I wrote about James Madison and his accomplishments as a politician. He made numerous achievements. He did more than help to define the United State's government form and established all of the liberties of all American Citizens, which impacted American politics in the 20th Century. I used 21st Century Skill #5; I conducted research to find this information.</h2>

    <h2>This is important in the 21st century,because it directly affects how we live today. James Madison was one of the leading contributors to the Constitution. Without the efforts of James Madison, our daily laws and regulations could be much different, and likely in a negative way.  </h2>
