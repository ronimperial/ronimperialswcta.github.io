    <h2>My Native American DBQ Outline meets standard 1.1, because it descries the interactions among Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in Colonial America. Using a 20th Century Skill (#3- Responding to Historical Text/Literature) I created an outline that would state how European and Indian attitudes toward one another changed overtime. I used artifacts and texts written and spoke by the people of that time.</h2>

    <h2>This is important in the 21st Century because it affected the outcome of the fate of Native Americans, as well as Europeans. I wrote about their differences and similiarities, and how they cooperated/quarreled among each other. If Native Americans were able to take back their land, the United States may have never been created, and everything would be a lot different.</h2>
